## Job‑Market Paper

> **“Adaptive Experiment Design for Estimating a General Class of Causal Effects.”**  
> Develops a unified adaptive‑experiment framework targeting efficient estimation of a wide class of causal parameters—including distributional effects and inequality measures—by sequentially updating treatment randomization to achieve minimal asymptotic variance. Empirical illustrations draw on the Oregon Health Experiment and simulation evidence.

## Working Papers

- **“Policy Learning with Compliance Guarantee”** (with Vadim Marmer & Kyungchul Song)  
  Maximin approach to policy design under budget constraints when treatment‑participation incentives differ between source and target populations; transforms into a problem with stochastic‑dominance constraints prioritizing likely compliers.

---

## Work in Progress

- **“Asymmetric and Optimal Bandwidth Selection in Estimation for First‑Price Auctions.”**  
  Extends the Guerre–Perrigne–Vuong (2000) estimator to regimes where the ratio of first‑ to second‑stage bandwidths converges to zero or infinity; shows optimal pointwise MSE achieved when the ratio converges to zero.
